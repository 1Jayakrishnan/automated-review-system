## Note About ML Models
```markdown
## 🔮 ML Models
The `ml_models/` folder is ignored in version control (`.gitignore`).  
You’ll need to place the required trained models in this folder to enable ML-based predictions.  

Since model files are usually large, they are not pushed to GitHub.  
You can either:
- Train your own models and save them into `ml_models/`, or  
- Request pre-trained models from the project maintainer.  
```
